        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 small can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 slices sourdough bread</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cream cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepped</li>
            <li>oil of your choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and dry produce. Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper into 1/2 inch pieces. Halve, peel, and dice onion. Peel and 
                finely chop garlic.</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until softened, 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add garlic and oregano; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30-60 
                seconds more. Stir in tomato paste until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Stir crushed tomatoes, stock, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp sugar into pot until combined. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat 
                to medium low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until soup has thickened slightly, 8-10 minutes. Season generously with 
                salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, evenly top one bread slice with cheddar. Top with remaining bread to form a sandwich. Melt 1/2 tbsp butter 
                in a large pan over medium heat. Add sandwich and cook until bread is golden brown on one side, 2-4 minutes. Add another 
                1/2 tbsp butter to pan and flip sandwich; cook until cheese melts, 2-3 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board.</li>
            <li>Once soup has thickened, stir in cream cheese until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>
                Once sandwich is cool enough to handle, cut into 1-inch pieces. Divide soup between bowls. Top with grilled-cheese 
                croutons.</li>
        </ol>
