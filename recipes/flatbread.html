            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
            <li>1 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</li> 
            <li>Wash and dry the zucchini and tomato. Trim off the top and bottom of the zucchini, cut in
                half lengthwise, and slice into 1/4 inch thick half-moons. Cut off the top and bottom of the onion and slice in half 
                through the root end. With one half of the onion, slice into half inch slices. With the other half, dice enough until 
                you have about 2 or 3 tablespoons. Dice tomato and set aside.</li>
            <li>Toss zucchini and sliced onion on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and season with salt, pepper, and 2 tsp of the 
                italian seasoning. Toast veggies until lightly browned, about 12-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While veggies roast, heat a drizzle of oil at medium-high heat in a small sautee pan and add diced onion. Once onions are 
                lightly browned, add in garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add in diced 
                toamto and cook another few minutes, until tomato has softened. Add in balsalmic vinegar and cook until liquid has 
                reduced. Turn heat off and stir in cream cheese. Taste sauce and reseason if necessary.</li>
            <li>Once zucchini and onion are done roasting, remove from oven.</li>
            <li>Place store-bought flatbread on a sheet pan and spread sauce evenly. Add roasted zucchini and onion, then top with 
                mozzarella. Place flatbread in the oven for another 5-8 minutes or until cheese is melted and starting to brown.</li>
            <li>Top with parmesan or chili flakes if desired and enjoy!</li>
