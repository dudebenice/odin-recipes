        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 zucchini</li>
            <li>1 shallot</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>1 small bunch parsley</li>
            <li>8 oz linguine</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable stock</li>
            <li>2 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parmesan</li>
            <li>salt and pepped</li>
            <li>oil of your choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. Trim zucchini; grate on the largest holes of a box 
                grater. Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallot. Peel and finely chop garlic. Zest and quarter lemon. Pick parsley leaves 
                from stems; finely chop leaves.</li>
            <li>Place zucchini in the center of a clean kitchen towel. Gather into a tight bundle and squeeze over the sink to remove 
                as much liquid as possible. (Alternatively, place zucchini in a fine-mesh sieve and press down with a spatula.)</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add grated zucchini, shallot, garlic, and 1/2 tsp salt. Cook, 
                stirring occasionally, until zucchini is caramelized and mixture is jammy and thickened, 15-18 minutes. (If zucchini 
                begins to brown too quickly, add a splash or two of water.)</li>
            <li>Once water is boiling, add pasta to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve a little 
                pasta water (about 1/4 cup), then drain.</li>
            <li>Add cream cheese, stock, italian Seasoning, a splash reserved pasta water, a big squeeze of lemon juice, and a 
                pinch of lemon zest to pan with zucchini mixture; whisk to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until smooth, 
                1-2 minutes. Turn off heat.</li>
            <li>Add drained pasta, half the parmesan, and half the parsley to pan. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in remaining lemon 
                zest if desired. If needed, add more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy 
                sauce. Divide between bowls; top with remaining parmesan and parsley. Sprinkle with chili flakes if desired. Serve with 
                remaining lemon wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
